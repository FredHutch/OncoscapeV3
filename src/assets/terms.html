<h1>Oncoscape Terms and Conditions</h1> 

Oncoscape is a collection of data submitted by various organizations, and Fred Hutch aims to add value to research by facilitating the sharing of this data with researchers and community members.  In consideration of my access to and use of this site Oncoscape, maintained by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”), I agree to the following terms and conditions:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><ol>
<li>I agree to upload and use only de-identified patient or research subject data in Oncoscape, as specified by NIH’s Genomic Data Sharing policy criteria: the identifiers of data subjects cannot be readily ascertained or otherwise associated with the data by the repository staff or secondary data users (45 CFR46 .102(f)); the 18 identifiers enumerated at 45 CFR 164.514(b)(2) (the HIPAA Privacy Rule) are removed; and the submitting institution has no actual knowledge that the remaining information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the subject of the data. </li>
<li>I agree that it is my responsibility to ensure that individuals cannot be identified by the data. I will not: (a) try to reveal the identity of any individuals by any means; or (b) publish or make by any means publicly available combinations of data with other data they possess, which can lead to the identification of individuals.</li>
<li>I agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the confidentiality of individually identifiable health information, including, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) (See: 45 CFR Parts 160, 162 and 164) and the regulations of the Office of Human Research Protection (45 CFR Part 46).</li>
<li>I understand and acknowledge that the public Oncoscape website is free for academic, nonprofit, and personal use. Access to and use of Oncoscape and the data for any commercial purposes, for example selling the data or services based on the data, is not allowed. I will not re-package, compile, re-distribute or re-use any or all of the data unless when permission to do so is granted in writing by the Oncoscape or the supplier(s) of particular set(s) of data.</li>
<li>Any use of the public browser requires credits to the browser site. I agree to inform Fred Hutch about my research or publicly-available research results generated by the use of data, including publications.</li>
