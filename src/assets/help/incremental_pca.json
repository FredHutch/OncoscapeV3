    "desc": "<span class='help-method'>Incremental principal components analysis (IPCA).</span>Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of centered data, keeping only the most significant singular vectors to project the data to a lower dimensional space. Depending on the size of the input data, this algorithm can be much more memory efficient than a PCA. This algorithm has constant memory complexity, on the order of batch_size, enabling use of np.memmap files without loading the entire file into memory. The computational overhead of each SVD is O(batch_size * n_features ** 2), but only 2 * batch_size samples remain in memory at a time. There will be n_samples / batch_size SVD computations to get the principal components, versus 1 large SVD of complexity O(n_samples * n_features ** 2) for PCA.
