  "desc": "<span class='help-method'>Linear Discriminant Analysis a classifier with a linear decision boundary, generated by fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayes’ rule. The model fits a Gaussian density to each class, assuming that all classes share the same covariance matrix. The fitted model can also be used to reduce the dimensionality of the input by projecting it to the most discriminative directions. New in version 0.17: LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.",
