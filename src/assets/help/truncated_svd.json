{"method":"Truncated SVD","desc":"Dimensionality reduction using truncated SVD (aka LSA).<br />This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of<br />truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). Contrary to PCA, this<br />estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value<br />decomposition. This means it can work with scipy.sparse matrices<br />efficiently.<br />In particular, truncated SVD works on term count/tf-idf matrices as<br />returned by the vectorizers in sklearn.feature_extraction.text. In that<br />context, it is known as latent semantic analysis (LSA).<br />This estimator supports two algorithms: a fast randomized SVD solver, and<br />a “naive” algorithm that uses ARPACK as an eigensolver on (X * X.T) or<br />(X.T * X), whichever is more efficient.<br />Read more in the User Guide.<br />","url":"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html#sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD","params":[{"name":"n_components","type":"int, default = 2","desc":"Desired dimensionality of output data.
