    <h1>To get started, all we need is some data.</h1>
    <h2>If you are interested in viewing your own data there are two options.<br />
    
        1) Upload the data to our private data hub and share it with your collaborators.
        <a href="https://dev.oncoscape.sttrcancer.io/upload/#/projects/dashboard">Visit Data Hub</a><br />
    
        2) Read the data directly off your computer and rest assured it will never be saved to the cloud.
