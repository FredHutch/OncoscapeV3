<p>STTR develops software products for scientists and clinicians who work with human genomics data in either a research or clinical setting, enabling them to extract maximal biological meaning and deliver the next generation of personalized medicine applications.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers wanting to incorporate information from TCGA into their workflows must download data stored at multiple locations, integrate them with their own data and then process this collection on powerful computational systems. This workflow has become untenable for most labs given the enormous growth of TCGA and other large-scale sequencing datasets.
In order to mitigate the daunting challenges inherent in managing and analyzing vast amounts of genomic data, STTR has built a cloud-based “Software as a Service” (SaaS) platform called Oncoscape. Oncoscape provides a persistent, secure and curated repository for storing, cataloging and accessing cancer genome sequence, alignment, sequence variation, expression, copy number and structural variation information from the TCGA consortium.        
“STTR has focused on integrating the data for somatic mutations, RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, protein expression, copy number and methylation across cancer types, and presenting it to researchers in an organized and intuitive manner,” said Eric Holland, Director of the STTR. “We are excited to be working with cancer researchers and are committed to ensuring that Oncoscape contains the most up-to-date TCGA content.”</p>
<p>STTR helps life science and healthcare organizations solve integration, collaboration, analysis, visualization, and reporting challenges associated with patient-derived genomics data. The company’s Oncoscape solution is available as a platform-as-a-service that provides customers with a rich set of built-in functionality alongside seamless integrations with a growing ecosystem of cloud-based storage, compute, and data processing technologies. Armed with Oncoscape, customers in translational research, biopharmaceutical, and clinical testing environments are maximizing value from their genomics information with an efficient and effective software infrastructure. STTR was founded by experts in commercial bioinformatics technology, who bring decades of collective expertise to support the company’s global customers.</p>
        
<h2>Matrix Decomposition</h2>
<p>Visualize the inherent spacial structure of high dimensional datasets in 3D.  With 13 fully customizable linear dimension reduction algorithm,
select from 5 variants of PCA, Factor Analysis, LDA, SVD and more.</p>

<h2>Manifold Learning</h2>
<p>Like Matrix Decomposion, Manifold Learning seeks to unveil the spacial structure of high dimensinoal datasets.  Unlike Matrix Decomposition the dimension reduction process is non-linear.
Availible methods include T-SNE, MDS, Isomap, Local Linear and Spectral Embedding.</p>

<h2>Heatmap</h2>
<p>Sort, Group and Visualize your data using 7 agglomerative clustering algorythems in conjunction with 20 distance metrics.  Leverage dendograpms to subselect populations of samples or markers for further investigation.
