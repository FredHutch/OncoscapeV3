        Our team assists researchers and clinicians extract maximal biological meaning from human genomic data through the development
        of custom software solutions. Our mission is to accelerate your science. Today, researchers wanting to augment their
        own datasets or analytic methods face many challenges including: identifying, downloading and storing data from multiple
        public repositories; developing scripts to integrate and interrogate these resources; creating novel data visualization
        to extract meaning. To help mitigate these challenges, the STTR has built a cloud-based platform called Oncoscape.
        Our platform allows researchers to easily upload mutation, expression, copy number, structural variation, clinical,
        and time series data; augment their data with a growing list of reference datasets including TCGA, Reactome, MSigDB,
        HGNC and BioMart; interrogate their data using industry standard libraries such as scikit learn, lifelines and bioC;
        Visualize data using any one of our XX tools. To learn more or request custom analysis contact oncoscape@fredhutch.org




        <h2>Matrix Decomposition</h2>
        <p>Visualize the inherent spacial structure of high dimensional datasets in 3D. With 13 fully customizable linear dimension
            reduction algorithm, select from 5 variants of PCA, Factor Analysis, LDA, SVD and more.</p>

        <h2>Manifold Learning</h2>
        <p>Like Matrix Decomposion, Manifold Learning seeks to unveil the spacial structure of high dimensinoal datasets. Unlike
            Matrix Decomposition the dimension reduction process is non-linear. Availible methods include T-SNE, MDS, Isomap,
            Local Linear and Spectral Embedding.</p>

        <h2>Heatmap</h2>
        <p>Sort, Group and Visualize your data using 7 agglomerative clustering algorythems in conjunction with 20 distance
            metrics. Leverage dendograpms to subselect populations of samples or markers for further investigation.

            <h2>Genome</h2>
            <p>Indentify chromosomal regions of interest by projecting your data onto a visual representation of the genome.
                Overlay CNV, Gistic or expression data along with Topically Alligned Domains and Cytobands. Explore thousands
                of curated genesets or create your own.</p>

            <h2>Chromosome</h2>
            <p>Compare datasets at the chormosomal level with circos and linear visualizations. Overlay pathways or topically
                alligned domains. </p>

            <h2>Pathways</h2>
            <p>Overlay your data on over 12,000 pathways extracted from Reactome and ...</p>
